// Given two strings ‘s1’ and ‘s2’, find the length of the longest subsequence which is common in both the strings.

// A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

// Example 1:

// Input: s1 = "abdca"
//        s2 = "cbda"
// Output: 3
// Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "bda".
// Example 2:

// Input: s1 = "passport"
//        s2 = "ppsspt"
// Output: 5
// Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "psspt".
